My program does not fully implement the selective repeat sliding window. 
It will correctly send the messages from the sender to the receiver. It
will correctly sends acks from the receiver to the sender if you enter Y. 
It will correctly queue the messages that haven't been acked and will send them
again after a certain amount of time. But the actual window part is not correct
for either the sender or receiver. It does not properly implement the sliding
and will buffer too many messages or send too many messages after the timeouts.
